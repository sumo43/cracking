### Call Center



### Class CallCenter:
- list of respondents
- smaller list of managers
- single call manager director



Whenever someone calls, they are assigned to the first respondent who is free. If the respondents are all busy, they are assigned to a manager that's free. If none of the managers are available, the call is assigned to the director.


class CallCenter {
    

    Respondent[] respondents;
    Manager[] managers;
    Director director;

    public boolean dispatchCall(Call call) {

        for (int i = 0; i < respondents.size(); i++){
            if(!respondents[i].isBusy()) {
                respondents[i].assign(call);
                return True;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < managers.size(); i++) {
            if(managers[i].isBusy()) {
                managers[i].assign(call);
                return True;
            }
        }
        if(!director.isBusy()) {
            director.assign(call);
        }
        return False;
    }
