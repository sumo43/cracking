### Deck of Cards


I would implement the stack of cards as a stack with max 53 cards, and the discarded cards as a second stack which also has a limit of 53 cards. Each card object would have a face and a number, and the stack would be initialized randomly, picking number and face from a list, then removing it

To play blackjack, there would be a player class, and a dealer that inherits from that class. Each player would have a hand, with add and remove methods. The players can draw from the deck, or hit. There would be a blackjack game class, which keeps track of the number of wins, and has an array of players, including the dealer.
